      <h1>API</h1>
      <p>First, a bit of philosophy:</p>
      <p>Java has most of the functionality a developer would want.  Sometimes the API for that functionality is insane.  For example, writing a file.  In these cases, Gosu will typically offer a simpler alternative, often built in to the obvious Java class, via enhancements.  Other times the API is fine and Gosu won't offer anything beyond that.</p>
      <p>Gosu is not an attempt to reinvent the world.  The core Java libraries are very solid and, in some cases, just lack a bit of simplicity or a bit of functionality, often due to a lack of features in Java.</p>
      <p>Because of that, the API that Gosu provides is relatively small and somewhat sporadic, addressing corners of the standard Java API that we were unhappy with.</p>
      <p>That being said, here are some highlights from the <code>gw.api</code> packages:
